# Global-grid-to-spherical-harmonics-
The code in conversion_ggr.py will take scattered data and generate spherical harmonic coefficients from it. 

It makes use of pyshtools least squares inversion (unweighted), see: https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/index.html (Wieczorek & Meschede, 2018)

The python script is modified from a file shared by S. Ghelichkhan: https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au/people/dr-sia-ghelichkhan.
